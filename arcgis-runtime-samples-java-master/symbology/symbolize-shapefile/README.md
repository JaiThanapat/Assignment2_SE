# Symbolize shapefile

Display a shapefile with custom symbology.

## Use case

Feature layers created from shapefiles do not possess any rendering information, and will be assigned with a default symbology. You can apply custom styling to ensure that the content is visible and usable in the context of a specific map. For example, you could use this to visually differentiate between features originating from two different shapefiles, by applying a blue color to one, and a red color to the other.

## How to use the sample

Press the toggle button to switch between the red and yellow symbology renderer and the default renderer, set to the feature layer created from the shapefile. 

## How it works

1. Create a `ShapefileFeatureTable`, providing the path to a shapefile.
2. Create a `FeatureLayer` from a `ShapeFileFeatureTable`.
3. Create a `SimpleRenderer` to override the default symbology. The simple renderer takes a symbol and applies that to all features in a layer.
4. Apply the renderer to the `FeatureLayer` by setting the renderer.

## About the data

This sample displays a shapefile containing subdivisions in Aurora, CO.

## Additional information

While shapefiles contain no rendering information, other data sources such as Service Feature Tables or Geodatabase Feature Tables can contain such information. As a result, the rendering properties of the other data sources can be pre-defined by the author.
