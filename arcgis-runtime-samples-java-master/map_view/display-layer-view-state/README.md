# Display layer view state

Determine if a layer is currently being viewed.

## Use case

The view status includes information on the loading state of layers and whether layers are visible at a given scale. You might change how a layer is displayed in a layer list to communicate whether it is being viewed in the map. For example, you could show a loading spinner next to its name when the view status is `LOADING`, grey out the name when `NOT_VISIBLE` or `OUT_OF_SCALE`, show the name normally when `ACTIVE`, or with a warning or error icon when the status is `WARNING` or `ERROR`.

## How to use the sample

Click "Load Layer" to add a feature layer to the map. The current view status of the layer will display at the top of the sample. Zoom in and out of the map and note the layer disappears when the map is scaled outside of its min and max scale range. Control the layer's visibility with the "Layer visible" checkbox. If you disconnect your device from the network and pan around the map, a warning alert will display. Reconnect to the network to remove the warning. The layer's current view status will update accordingly as you carry out these actions.

## How it works

1. Create an `ArcGISMap` with some operational layers.
2. Set the map on a `MapView`.
3. Add a `LayerViewStateChangedListener` to the map view to capture `LayerViewStateChangedEvent`.
4. Get the current view status with `event.getLayerViewStatus()`.
